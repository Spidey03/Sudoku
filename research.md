## [Backtracking Algorithm](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/backtracking-algorithms)

A **backtracking** algorithm is a problem-solving algorithm that uses a [_brute force_](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/brute-force-cybersecurity-string-search) approach for finding the desired output.

**Backtracking** is an algorithmic technique where the goal is to get all solutions to a problem using the brute force approach. It consists of building a set of all the solutions incrementally. Since a problem would have constraints, the solutions that fail to satisfy them will be removed.
